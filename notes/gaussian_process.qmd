```{r}
library(targets)
library(mgcv)
library(gratia)
tar_load(c(gam_50gdd, gam_50gdd_gp), store = here::here("_targets"))
```

```{r}
summary(gam_50gdd)
```

```{r}
summary(gam_50gdd_gp)
```

```{r}
AIC(gam_50gdd, gam_50gdd_gp)
```

The tensor product version (original) has slightly higher R2 and lower AIC.

```{r}
tar_meta(starts_with("gam_50gdd"), fields = "seconds")
```

It also is slightly faster to run as a tensor product (surprising)\
\

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(tar_read(smooths_50gdd, store = here::here("_targets")))
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(tar_read(smooths_50gdd_gp, store = here::here("_targets")))
```

Partial effects plots are nearly identical, so stick with tensor product.
