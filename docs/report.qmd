This now includes all the planned thresholds: 50, 650, 1250, 1950 and 2500 GDD (ºF).

## Summary statistics plots

### Min, Mean, Max

::: callout-note
These are calculated with `na.rm = TRUE` to remove NAs, so not every pixel necessarily has the same number of years used to calculate these summary statistics.
:::

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(summary_plot)
```

### Standard Deviation

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(sd_plot)
```

### Number of years threshold is reached

These plots may be helpful along with standard deviation for interpretation since standard deviation may be calculated with a different sample size[^1] for different pixels.

[^1]: It's not really sample size, since `NA`s don't quite represent missing data here—they just indicate the threshold was never reached in that year

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(count_plot)
```

## Model Diagnostics

Model diagnostics produced with `gratia::appraise()`.
This indicates that some GDD thresholds might need "bespoke" treatment.
E.g. residuals for 2500 are leptokurtic and might be better if a student t error distribution was used instead of gaussian.
On the other hand, $n$ is so high it probably makes no difference.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(appraisals)
```

Similarly, the number of basis functions used (`k'`) might need to be adjusted for some models.
Ideally `edf` (estimated degrees of freedom) should be much less than `k'`, which is not the case for the spatial smooth (`ti(x,y)`) for 1950 GDD.

```{r}
df <- dplyr::bind_rows(k_check_50, k_check_650, k_check_1250, k_check_1950, k_check_2500)
tt(df %>% select(-gam)) %>% 
    group_tt(i = df$gam) %>%
    style_tt(i = .@group_index_i, background = "#b2b2b2")
```

## Average Slopes Plots

These plots average instantaneous slopes at each year.
At each pixel, the hypothesis that the slope = 0 is tested and resulting p-values are corrected for false discovery rate.
Actual p-values are not displayed, they're just used to "block out" areas that are not significantly different from zero.\

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Technical notes about p-values

There are different methods for estimating uncertainty (and therefore p-values?) around estimated slopes.
Currently I'm using the default in [`marginaleffects::avg_slopes()`](https://marginaleffects.com/chapters/slopes.html#aggregation) which is to use the variance-covariance matrix returned by `vcov(gam)`—in this case this is the Bayesian posterior covariance matrix.
There are options in [`mgcv::vcov.gam()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mgcv/versions/1.9-1/topics/vcov.gam) that could be modified or other methods like bootstrapping can be used via the [`marginaleffects::inferences()`](https://marginaleffects.com/man/r/inferences.html) function.
I honestly have little idea what is best here and will explore some different options.\

\
Another entirely different option that may be more appropriate because of its GAM-specificity is [`gratia::response_derivatives()`](https://gavinsimpson.github.io/gratia/reference/response_derivatives.html)`.`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(slope_plots)
```

::: callout-warning
For the 2500 GDD threshold, there actually isn't any data in the most northern parts of the US and the fitted values from the GAM should be ignored there.
A refined version of this plot could remove any pixels too far from where there is actual observed data (a common practice for visualizing 2D smooths from GAMs).
